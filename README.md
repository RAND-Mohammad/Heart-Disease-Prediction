# Heart-Disease-Prediction
**Description:**  
Team Work Project  
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques.  
It includes a Python codebase, a database of patient data, and a detailed project report.  
We worked on data preprocessing, analysis, model training, visualization, and reporting to create an accurate prediction system.

**Features:**  
- Analysis of patient health data from the database  
- Training a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk  
- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics and ROC Curve  
- Comprehensive project report summarizing methodology, results, and conclusions  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- Database  

**How to Run:**  
1. Download the complete project to your local machine.  
2. Ensure the database file is in the `data/` folder.  
3. Open `notebooks/HeartDisease.ipynb` to run the model and analyze the data.
